"""to_scipy_sparse_array must preserve networkx's dtype on multigraphs.

br-r37-c1-p80x1. Found by a systematic f(G) divergence sweep of the public surface
(445 functions x 4 classes x 3 seeds). networkx returns float64 whenever the weight
attribute holds a FLOAT, even when that float is integral-valued; fnx's multigraph fast
path returns int64 in exactly that case.

    class          weights            fnx        nx
    MultiGraph     2.0, 3.0           int64      float64      <- diverges
    MultiDiGraph   2.0, 3.0           int64      float64      <- diverges
    MultiGraph     2, 3               agree
    MultiGraph     2.5, 0.25          agree (float64)
    MultiGraph     no weight attr     agree
    Graph/DiGraph  every case         agree

The VALUES are equal - this is not a truncation bug, and non-integral weights are handled
correctly - but the dtype is wrong, which matters for drop-in code that inspects `.dtype`,
feeds the array to a scipy routine with a dtype expectation, or relies on float semantics
downstream (later division, NaN propagation).

CAUSE, from python/franken_networkx/__init__.py: the multigraph fast path reads
`data_is_int` from the native CSR kernel and picks
`_np.int64 if data_is_int else _np.float64`. The kernel decides that from the summed
VALUES being integral, whereas networkx decides from the source weight's TYPE. Repairing it
properly means changing what the kernel reports, which is a Rust change; a Python-side
repair would need an O(|E|) scan of the weights and would cost the fast path its reason to
exist.

MARKED xfail(strict=True) DELIBERATELY: the tree stays green, and the day the kernel is
fixed this test fails as XPASS and forces the marker off, rather than silently passing and
leaving a stale xfail behind.
